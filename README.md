# ZJUNlict Main Board (Test) Description

The main board (test) combines the original [mother board](https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Mother_Board) and [motor driver board](https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Motor_Driver_Board). (The board is designed using [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer/) 17.1)

The PCB is designed in four-layer board configuration due to the high current and complex routing requirement. The 2D and 3D design views are shown below:

The main features are:

* Combine mother board and motor driver board to reduce the height and number of the boards.
* Compactible with the current [core board](https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Core_Board) and [booster board](https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Booster_Board).

The photos of the main board (test) are shown below as references.
